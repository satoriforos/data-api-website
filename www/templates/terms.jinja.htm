					Third Party Content. The API Site API may provide access to content owned by API Site users and not by API Site (Third Party Content). User agrees to comply with any and all requirements or restrictions imposed with respect to usage of such Third Party Content by its respective owners. User is solely responsible for making use of Third Party Content in compliance with the owners' requirements or restrictions. If the owner of any Third Party Content requests the removal of such Third Party Content from a User website or application that makes use of the API Site API (User Website), User agrees to comply with such request within 24 hours following receipt of such request.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>. User will disclose in each User Website a privacy policy or similar document describing how User collects, uses, stores and discloses data collected from visitors, including, where applicable, that third parties (including advertisers) may serve content and/or advertisements to users of the User Website, collect information directly from users of the User Website, and place or recognize cookies on such users' browsers.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All calls to the API Site API must reference the API key issued to User as an approved subscriber. User agrees to keep the API key confidential, and not to share it with any third party. This license is personal to you, and any affiliates must seek and obtain their own license and API key.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Ownership;</strong> No Implied License
				</p>
				<p>
					The API Site API and API Site logos are protected by copyright, trademark, service mark, and/or other intellectual property rights laws of the US and other countries. API Site's rights apply to the API Site API and all output and executables of the API Site API excluding any software components developed by User which do not themselves incorporate the API Site API or any output or executables of the API Site API. Except for the limited license expressly granted herein, no other license is granted, no other use is permitted and API Site (and its licensors) shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the API Site API and API Site logos.
				</p>

				<h2>Fees</h2>
				<p>
					The API Site API is available free to API Site users; however, for certain types of commercial applications or for a certain rate of usage of the API Site API, API Site reserves the right to charge fees. In order to use the API Site API, User must obtain an API key from API Site. The API key must be part of each and every call User makes to the API Site API service, regardless of the HTTP method used by User. If API Site determines that User's use of the API Site API is commercial, User's request for an API key may be granted subject to User's payment of license fees. An application is considered a commercial application if: (i) the primary purpose of User's application is to derive revenue, (ii) User charges its users a fee for products or services including integration using the API Site API, (iii) User sells services to API Site users and uses the API Site API to bring API Site users' content into User's service, or (iv) User's site is a "destination" site that uses API Site videos to drive traffic and generate ad revenue. API Site may monitor the User Website over time to ensure continued compliance with the appropriate type of API key.
				</p>

				<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
				<p>
					EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE API Site API, OTHER SOFTWARE, THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND API Site LOGOS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, API Site HEREBY DISCLAIMS (FOR ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS) ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, WITH RESPECT TO THE API Site API, OTHER SOFTWARE, THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND API Site LOGOS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, INTEGRATION, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.
				</p>

				<h2>Indemnification</h2>
				<p>
					User agrees to (a) defend API Site and its affiliates and their directors, officers, suppliers, employees and agents (API Site Indemnitees) against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to its use of the API Site API, API Site Data, or API Site brand & logos, including but not limited to any claim that the User Website, the content of the User Website, or any products developed under this Agreement by User, infringe upon or violate any third party's intellectual property rights, and (b) indemnify the API Site Indemnitees for settlement amounts, liabilities, costs and expenses awarded and arising out of such claim. A API Site Indemnitee shall give User (a) prompt written notice of any such claim or allegation, (b) control of the defense and settlement thereof (provided that any settlement of such claim that does not contain an unconditional release of the API Site Indemnitee will require the prior written consent of such API Site Indemnitee) and (c) reasonable assistance in such defense or settlement.
				</p>
				<h2>Limited Liability</h2>
				<p>
					EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, In no event shall API Site (or its LICENSORS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES OR DATA PROVIDERS) BE LIABLE CONCERNING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF thE agreement, regardless of the form of any claim or action (whether in CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERwise), for any (A) MATTER BEYOND ITS REASONABLE CONTROL, (B) LOSS or inaccuracy of data, loss or interruption OF USE, OR COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGY, GOODS or SERVICES, (C) INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF BUSINESS, REVENUES, PROFITS OR GOODWILL or (D) damages, in the aggregate, in excess of the FEES PAID BY USER TO API Site, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS ARE INDEPENDENT FROM ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT AND SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
				</p>
				<h2>Term and Termination</h2>
				<p>
					The license granted herein continues in effect until terminated by either party. User may terminate the license by discontinuing use of the API Site API. API Site may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason. User's rights to use the API Site API terminate automatically if (i) User violates any of the API Term and Conditions, (ii) API Site publicly posts a written notice of termination on example.com, (iii) API Site sends a written notice of termination to User, or (iv) API Site disables access to the API Site API to User. All remedies for breach, and the provisions of Section 2, and Sections 4 through 13 shall survive any termination of the API Terms and Conditions.
				</p>
				<h2>Assignment</h2>
				<p>
					This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned or otherwise transferred by User. Any attempted transfer in violation hereof will be void and of no effect. This Agreement will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors, representatives, and permitted assigns of the parties.
				</p>
				<h2>Publicity</h2>
				<p>
					User hereby consents to API Site's inclusion of its name in User listings that may be published as part of API Site's marketing efforts.
				</p>
				<h2>Independent Contractors</h2>
				<p>
					The parties shall be independent contractors in their performance under this Agreement, and nothing contained herein will constitute either party as the employer, employee, agent or representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. While User may publicly refer to the fact that User has implemented the API Site API, User agrees not to make other public statements that assert or imply any other relationship with API Site, Inc., with API Site's prior written approval.
				</p>

				<h2>General</h2>
				<p>
					The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior negotiations and agreements (oral or written), between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof. The Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any action hereunder is in the federal and state courts located in New York. Any breach of Section 2 (Restrictions) will cause irreparable harm to API Site for which money damages are not an adequate remedy. Therefore, in addition to any other remedy, API Site shall be entitled to an injunction or similar equitable relief against any such breach or threatened breach without the necessity of posting any bond. In any action or proceeding to enforce or interpret this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover the costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that it incurred in connection with such action or proceeding and enforcing any judgment or order obtained. No modification, waiver or consent hereunder will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against which enforcement is sought. The failure of either party to enforce its rights at any time shall not be construed as a waiver. Except as specifically provided otherwise, each right and remedy in this Agreement is in addition to any other right or remedy, at law or in equity, and the exercise of one right or remedy will not be deemed a waiver of any other right or remedy. If any provision is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and enforceable.
